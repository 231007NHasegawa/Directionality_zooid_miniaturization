# Directionality_zooid_miniaturization

# Overview
# This repository contains data and resources for our academic project focused on inferring the evolution of zooid miniaturization in colonial animals, especially styelid ascidians. The findings from this project have been published in: Naohiro Hasegawa, Shin Matsubara, Akira Shiraishi, Honoo Satake, Noa Shenkar, Hiroshi Kajihara (####) TENTATIVE TITLE: From Solitary to Colonial Accompanying Miniaturization: Ancestral State Reconstruction based on Phylogenomic Analysis of Styelid Ascidians. JOURNAL ####. VOLUME(ISSUE): ###-###. URL.

# Background
# Colonial animals, such as ascidians, corals, and bryozoans, consist of individual units known as zooids. While the phenomenon of zooid miniaturization in colonial animals has been reported, the evolutionary mechanisms and patterns behind this trend have remained unexplored. An ancestoral state reconstruction on a phylogenomic analysis inferred that directional miniaturization of zooids has been occured through the evolutionary process of colonial ascidians in Styelidae. This repository contains the data and resources that supported our findings.
