# Directionality_zooid_miniaturization

# Overview
### Colonial animals, such as ascidians, corals, and bryozoans, consist of individual units known as zooids. While the phenomenon of zooid miniaturization in colonial animals has been reported, the evolutionary mechanisms and patterns behind this trend have remained unexplored. An ancestral state reconstruction based on a phylogenomic analysis inferred that there has been a directional miniaturization of zooids throughout the evolutionary process of colonial ascidians in the Styelidae family. This repository contains the data and resources that supported our findings, and it serves as our academic project repository for the study of zooid miniaturization accompanying the transition from solitary to colonial life forms in ascidians.
